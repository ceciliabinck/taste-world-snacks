I have had no ideas for this project and after a while, I had a couple of ideas to play around with. Those ideas where:
1. Make a web store where customers can purchase products from Nepal, to support a friend.
2. Make a web store where customers can purchase products from around the world.
3. Make a web store where customers can purchase a subscription for a box with snacks from around the world.

It took me a couple of days pick which idea I wanted to use for my last project but I am very happy with the decision I made to go with option 3. I choose this idea because I always like to try new snacks and food when I am travelling abroad. I have found some winners that I go to after trying them on my trip or send to me. Now I know that there are already companies that do this by surprising customers with the month box. The home page is https://taste-world-snacks.herokuapp.com/.

I want to give customers the option of being surprised or picking their country box. After snacking and finding out which snack you can not live without. The customer can find different snacks from the boxes in our shop. The other reason why I decided to include our shop, is from personal experience. Because when you find the snack you can't live without any more in a different country. The big question will be, can I find this at home? Sadly this is for a lot of things, not the case. So I want to bring in that segment of the market. where people that have that snack that they fell in love with but can't find it at home or after trying a box. 

I agree with some of the other companies that you can not keep this a secret but that you have to share this experience with others. So customers will also have the option to give a box to someone else.

# UX

## Design Choices

This project is about snacks and that means all kinds that you can think of chocolate, cookies, candy, chips, crackers, etc. The thing that makes this kind of shop a great experience is that it is really like travelling. You travel around the world by taste. You will get a better understanding of what people like around the world and that will not always be what you like. It could also be a good help in finding a new holiday destination if you love their snacks.

### Typography

I have not put a lot of energy into picking a special font. I have to say I just followed along with the Boutique Aldo structure as I thought it looked nice. the font that I am using is <strong>Lato</strong>. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. I find that <strong>Lato</strong> is a font that is easy to read so that makes it easy to read for everyone that would visite te site.

#### Changes

I have had this fond for a couple of weeks now and I do still like that it is a simple and strong font. Although I find that this project needs another font to lift it up more. I am missing some elegance and movement there where the font has a bigger size. I went back to Google font and took a good look at the different fonts. I choose 2 possible options <strong>Oregano</strong> and <strong>Paprika</strong>. <strong>Oregano</strong> is an elegant, looks a bit Azian and is very different to <strong>Lato</strong>. <strong>Paprika</strong> is more similar to <strong>Lato</strong> and not as elegant as <strong>Oregano</strong> but the movement in it makes it move playful to me and I was looking for that most of all. I decided that the project could better do with some playfulness than the touch of elegance so I choose for the font <strong>Paprika</strong>.

## Colours

I want to colour to be one of the colours in the hero image. It took a while before I found a suitable image that represented what I wanted to bring over to customers. It is not perfect for it but it is the closest I found, as I do not know anyone how could make me the perfect hero image. I liked the orange/salmon colour on the bottom that ties everything together. This made me choose this colour to use in my design to tie everything together. But because I did not know what colour they used on that image I had to go and look for colours that looked like this colour. I found a website with a colour that was close but not yet that colour. So I started playing around in DevTools and found a colour that looked very similar. That was how I found the colour <strong>#ffa368</strong>.

#### Changes

In my second meeting with my mentor he told me for a website marketing to sell snacks it was not calling out candy/snacks, he meant a bit boring and average. It needed more colour. In my research for this website, I have seen very colourful websites but also less colourful. Although I got the feeling that the once with more colour did better. So I had to go and look for another colour and find the best places to put in some extra colour. I decided to look up the hex of the colour that I have chosen and found a website that showed colour schemes with my main colour <strong>#ffa368</strong>. The complementary colour they had chosen to put next to my colour, I loved. This is the colour <strong>#68c4ff</strong>.

## Icons 

I thought that this project needed some icons as I have seen in my research, websites use icons to make scanning their website more visible. How doesn't know the icon for the shopping bag or account? I have used icons only in my footer and in my navbar to give an extra visible element to my project. I used the icons from the icons library from Fontawesome. The icons are easy to understand and they provide visual support to the input fields.

## Imagery

As I have seen in my research are images on your website very important and not only for the products that you want to sell. I have added images mostly on the home page next to the product images. Although the hero image is small it does catch the eye of the customer. On the next section of the home page, how the concept works. There are three images that make the explanation of how the idea of the concept get a box works more visual. The next section is where I explain what customers can expect in their box. I have added an image in the middle and the explanation of what they can find in there box around it.

Although it is also very important to have working product images because how many customers will buy a product that has no image? In the case that a product image doesn't work I have put in an if statement that will add a nonimage image so that customers will not see a broken image tag.


## Wireframes

I built the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq. I had to do some research to get a better idea of how the design would look like. With most of the pages, I started with the desktop version and translated them to the tablet/mobile version. I choose to keep the tablet and mobile version together as they would not differ too much from each other. As most of the main content is displayed in columns in a row.

## Testing by others

I have asked people on Slack and family to test my project and tell me the issues they have with it.

- Test user 1
    - **Issue 1**: In the how it works section I forgot to take out the part where it tells that you can choose your own country
     **Solution**: I removed this content from the how it works section
    - **Issue 2**: On the country page what did those countries mean/ where is the intro to these counties?
     **Solution**: I wrote an intro for the country page, explaining what the meaning is of those counties

- Test user 2
    - **Issue 1**: In the section what do customers think there are no dates with the reviews. So how do customers know from when they are?
     **Solution**: I added a paragraph within there a date for the review

- Test user 3
    - **Issue 1**: The sorting navbar on the shop page gives an error 500
     **Solution**: I had sliced the queryset to display only the first 15 products. Turned out that it can not sort when the queryset is sliced. So I added an if statement in the code after the for loop, that it should not show any products with the name Original or Premium.
    - **Issue 2**: I had made some typos on the 2 box length pages
     **Solution**: I corrected the typos

- Test user 4 
    - **Issue 1**: When I click on "get a box", I get a 500 error
     **Solution**: Turned out that there something went wrong with the boxes table in Postgres after I migrated to Heroku. So I had to remove my Postgres database and I had to migrate push to Heroku again. After that was done I had to manually insert all the data.

### Browser testing

On Chrome, Opera, Ecosia as on Microsoft Edge the project work well. I can add products from the shop and the box in the bag, go to the shopping bag, do a payment and all the links work correctly. 

I found that there was an error on the box_original.html as I did not write the redirect_url correctly

# Issues

## Solved Issues

- Issue  header/Navbar

![Issue header/Navbar](https://github.com/ceciliabinck/taste-world-snacks/blob/master/media/images/bug-header-navbar.jpg)

While scrolling through the page. I saw that the content would scroll behind the navbar. Turned out that the padding and margin-left open spaces in the Navbar. So when I removed the padding and margin there was no more content shown behind the header/navbar when scrolling through the page.

- Issue Footer

After testing the delete link in the bag. I saw that the footer was not at the bottom of the page but under the content. I did not set any height for the HTML or the body so that made the footer float up. I added a height of h-100 next the HTML and body and gave the footer mt-auto py-3 and the footer stayed at the bottom of the page.

- Issue merging images

I started putting images in the static folder. But now only static files could go in the static folder and images have to go in the media folder. When I moved the images folder in the media folder and adjusted my URL for my images it gave an error. I was writing the image URL as in Flask. One of the tutors told me that in Django image URLs are written differently. So after adjusting the image URLs it worked correctly.

- Issue boxes subscriptions

I wanted to make two directions in the project. A shop direction and a box subscription direction. I made the shop side first and after I finished. When I got the subscription part so far that the last step was adding them to the bag and checkout. If I wanted to make this work I had to rewrite 3 to 4 pages. So I decided to add them as products and present in a different manner. I limiting the queryset to show only the boxes that I wanted but this means that they have to be adjusted every time a new product is inserted or a product gets delete until a better solution is found.

## Unsolved Issues

- Issue update link

The update link to update the form after a customer adjusted the quantity is outside the form, as it does not have to submit anything. This means that the form will not catch it when a customer adjusts the quantity to outside the allowed scope. The buttons and arrows in and around the input field in the shopping bag are restricted as in the product detail page. Adding the update link to a button in the form gives it that last check but the delete link doesn't work correctly inside the form. 

- Issue select buttons on the box length pages.

I wanted to limit the number of box subscription a customer can buy. I have removed the quantity input on the box length page and the bag but a customer can click on the add to bag button more than once. I have tried to make it less noticeable to redirect them to the home page after clicking on the add to bag button.

- Issue sort in shop

I limit the queryset like with the boxes but it turned out that it could not sort when the queryset was sliced, it gave a 500 error. So I added the an if statement that would not show the products with the name Original and Premium. But I found out that with sorting on the country and by name it leaves two open spaces on large screens, I am not sure why.

- Issue with floating footers

In my last walk throughout the project, I have seen that some of the pages from the Allauth package have a floating footer.

# Deployment

## Setting up the database and Heroku app

- Go heroku.com, create an account or log in. <i>I already have an account so I just had to log in.</i> 
- Click on new and then on new app. Give your app a name, it has to be unique. <i>I called my app taste-world-snacks.</i> Then choose the region closest to you and lastly click on create app button.

- Go to the resources tab, go to the add-ons and search for Heroku Postgres. Use the free plan and click on the submit order form button.

- Go back to your code editor and install dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary , for the use of heroku Postgres.  <i>pip3 install dj_database_url and pip3 install psycopg2-binary.</i> After that freeze the requirements, <i>pip3 freeze > requirementstxt</i>.

- Go to settings.py and import dj_database_url.  Go to the database settings section and  comment out the the default configuration and add a new database default with a call to dj_database_url.parse(). Go back to Heroku, go to the settings tab and reveal the config vars. Copy the database-url value and past this into the parentheses (). 
<i>DATABASE = {
	'default': dj_database_url.parse('here comes you database-url value')
}</i>

- Because you're using Postgres, you have to run all the migrations again, you can see this when you run python3 manage.py show migrations as the boxes are no longer checked. If you used JSON files to upload your categories an products you have to load them again. If you add them manually then you have again after your app is deployed to Heroku.

- Create a new superuser, <i>python3 manage.py createsuperuser,</i> and follow the steps. Your Heroku app and database are ready to go so remove the new database default and uncomment the original database default. You do this last step to make sure your database URL doesn't end up in version control and people can't use it for them selfs.

-  Then add, commit and push to Github.

## Deploying to Heroku

- In settings.py go back to the database section. You're going to going to set your database default in an if statement, if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:. So that when our app is running on Heroku we connect to Postgres otherwise we connect to your local database. The first part of this if statement is going to be the default database for when connected to Heroku and it will be similar to the default database code you just removed but with your Heroku URL secured

        DATABASE = {
	        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL))
        }

Put the original database default in an else statement

else:

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }

- To be able to deploy to Heroku you need a couple of other things:
 	- Install gunicor, <i>that will act as a web server,</i> and freeze this in the requirments.txt

	- Create a Procfile, it needs the capital P. To tell Heroku to create a web dyno, <i>which will run gunicorn and serve our Django app</i>. You open a new file and add this to the file. web: gunicorn taste_world_snacks.wsgi:application

- Login to Heroku in the console. To log in, you can use the command Heroku login or Heroku login -i and follow the steps. Then temporarily disable collective static by using the command Heroku config: set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app taste-world-snacks, <i>so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy</i>.

- You need to add taste-world-snacks to allowed hosts in settings.py and add the localhost as well, <i>so that you can still work on it. I tidied up secured later so I could test automatic deployment.</i> Then add, commit and push to Github.

- To deploy to Heroku using the commands:
	- heroku git:remove -a taste-world-snacks
	- git push heroku master

- To set up automatic deployment go to the deploy tab on Heroku and click on connect to Github. Search for the correct repository and then click connect, after that go to the Enable Automatic Deploys button and click it.

- Then to add secure, look up a secret key generator and generate a secret key. Copy that and go to the settings tab in Heroku, reveal config vars to make a new key with the name SECRET_KEY and past in your generated secret key in the value field and add it. After that go settings.py to replays the SECRET_KEY value with a call to get it from the environment with an empty string as default, <i>SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '').</i>

- Set DEBUG to be true only if there is a variable called development, <i>DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ.</i> Lastly add, commit and push to Github. If you go to the activity tab on Heroku, you can see there is a build-in progress and that your automatic deployment is working.

## Store static files and images on AWS

### Setup bucket

- Go to aws.amazon.com there create an account and follow the steps or log in. <i>I already have an account from a previous project so I only had to log in.</i>

- Once logged in search for S3 and open it and create a new bucket and give it a name. to keep it simple I gave it my Heroku app name, taste-world-snacks. Then select the region that is close to you, uncheck block all public access and acknowledge that the bucket will be public. <i><u>It needs to be public to allow public access to our static files.</i></u> Then click create bucket

- The new bucket needs a few basic settings. 
	- To do that select your bucket, go to properties tab, look for static website hosting and click edit and click on enable and host a static website. <i>I used index.html and error.html as index 	and error documents. As this is for educational use so I can go with defaults.</i> 

	- Then go to the permission tab, from there the cors configuration tab and click edit. <i>I pasted 	in the Cors configuration provided by school.</i> <u><i>This is to setup the required access between our Heroku app and this S3 bucket. </i></u>

	- Then under the policy tab in the permission tab select policy generator to create a security policy for the bucket. The policy type is S3 bucket policy, effects will be allow, principal will be *,  action will be get object and the ARN you can find on top of the bucket policy tab. Click add statement, then generate policy. Copy this policy into the bucket policy editor and add a 	/*  on to the end of the resource key to allow all access to all resources in the bucket and finally click save. Leave the policy generate window open for when you will create a user.

	- As the last step go to the access control list tab and select public access to everyone, select list and understand the effects and save.

### Setup user to access bucket

- Go back to the server menu and open I am. Click on groups, create a new group and give it a name. <i>To keep it simple I gave it the name manage-taste-world-snacks.</i> Then click on create group.

- To make a policy to use to access our bucket click on policies and then create policy. Go to the JSON tab, click on import managed policy, search for S3, choose AmazonS3FullAccess and import. As I only want full access to the bucket and everything in it, you will go to the policy generate page that you left open and copy the ARN behind resource. You can paste this in the list behind resource and in a second line past it in again but with /* behind it. Click review policy, give it a name and description and click create policy. <i>I name mine taste-world-snacks and as description, I added to access S3 bucket for taste world snacks static files.</i>

- You will attach the policy to the group you just created. To do so go to groups, click on the group that was just made, click attach policy, search for the policy with the name that you just made, select it and click attach policy.

- Then finally you will create a user to put in the group. Click on users page, click add user and give it a name. <i>I called it taste-world-snacks-staticfiles-user.</i> select programmatic access as access type, click next, select your group, click through till the end and then click create user. Download the CSV file with the user access key and secret key and click close. <u><i>It is very important to download and save this file as it cannot be downloaded or accessed again.</i></u>

## Connect S3 bucket to Django

- In the code editor install bato 3, django-storages and freeze them. Add storages  in settings.py under installed apps. 
	<i>-pip3 install bato 3, pip3 install django-storages, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt</i>

- You need to add the next settings under the media root section of settings.py to tell it with which bucket to communicate with. Add an if statement to check if there is an environment variable called use aws and give it these variables with the corresponding values:

        if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
	        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME,
	        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME,
   	        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
	        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

- Then go to Heroku settings tap and reveal config vars to add:
	- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
	- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
	- USE_AWS with value True
- You can find the credentials in the CSV file you downloaded from AWS and remove the DISABLE COLLECTSTATIC variable.

- In your code editor create a file named custom_storages.py to tell Django where to store static files and uploaded product images when you run collect static files. In this file you import settings from django.config and import S3Boto3Storage from storages.backends.s3boto3. Add a class to tell Django where to store static files and another for where to store media files.

	    from django.conf import settings
	    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


	    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   		    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


	    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    		    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

- Then go back to settings.py to tell it that for static file storage you want to use the StaticStorage class, for media files you want MediaStorage and what location it should save them.

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
   	    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
        MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

â€ƒ
- You also need to override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files using your custom domain and new locations.

	    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
        MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

## Adding other files to S3 bucket

- You can add an extra setting to the use aws if statement in settings.py, that will tell the browser that it is okay to cache static files for a long time.

	    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
       		 'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
       		 'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    	}

- To add media files to your S3 bucket, you need to go back to awsamazon.com, open S3, open your bucket,   click on create folder and give it a name. I called mine media. Open this folder, click upload then click on add files, then select all the images you want to select and click upload.
<i>If you have your images on Github than download them first from there and make sure that you add your images in with the same path as in your local database, example images/image.jpg.</i>
